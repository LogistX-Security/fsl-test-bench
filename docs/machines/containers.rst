Containers
==========
The high-interaction "honeypots" are running as `LXC`_ (Linux containers).  
LXC provides system-level virtualization which has its own processes and own
network space. This means that the containers are able to run linux systems 
in a isolated and virtual environment. The containers are separated from the
FSL Test Bench and are using `libvirt`_ for the network.

Network
-------
The containers are placed in a separated network which is running in **route**
mode. This way the network traffic from the containers can pass back and forth
without using NAT. The downside is that additional configuration on the clients
is needed. 

- Network mode: Routed
- Gateway: 10.10.1.1 (MAC address: 52:52:11:11:11:11)
- Network: 10.10.1.0/255
- DHCP: on
- DHCP range: 10.10.1.50 - 10.10.1.60

To access the container network you need to add a static route the this network.
libvirt acts as virtual router on your FSL Test Bench and the
hosts on the physical network do not know that there is a subnet. ::

    $ sudo route add -net 10.10.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw [IP address of your FSL Test Bench] dev [Interface]

After adding the route, check if the containers are responding.

Management
----------
The containers are launched automatically then the FSL Test
Bench starts. It makes sense to shut them down if you are running a system which
has only limited resources and you are working on different sections. 

There are several ways for maintaining the containers. If you have a SSH
connection to your Test Bench, you can use ``virsh``.

Show all running containers::

    # virsh --connect lxc:/// list --all

For stopping::

    # virsh --connect lxc:/// shutdown [container name]

For starting::

    # virsh --connect lxc:/// start [container name]

For more details about ``virsh`` please check the virsh man page. ::

    $ man virsh

or the `virsh command reference`_.

For managing the containers in a GUI way launch `Virtual Machine Manager`_
(``virt-manager``). The first step is to connect to your FSL
Test Bench. Goto **File** and choose **Add connection...** after
`Virtual Machine Manager`_ was started. Choose **LXC (Linux Containers)**
as Hypervisor, **SSH** as Method, **root** as Username is ok, and enter the
IP address of FSL Test Bench.

All containers can now be manipulated (shutdown, reboot, etc.) like virtual 
machine hosted on your local system if you have any.

`Virtual Machine Manager`_ will present you a login shell after you have open
a container.
